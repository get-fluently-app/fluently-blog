## Why speaking is hard

Most people study English but don't speak English.

Speaking needs fast recall, clear pronunciation and a bit of confidence.

Small daily practice helps more than long study sessions.

## Short preview of the 12 methods

### 1. Speak every day
Even 3 to 5 minutes is enough.

### 2. Shadowing
Repeat native speakers out loud. Good for sound and rhythm.

### 3. Think in English
Avoid translating. It slows your mouth and brain.

### 4. Talk about your day
Simple, real, helpful.

### 5. Improve pronunciation slowly
You don’t need perfect accent. You just need clarity.

### 6. Repeat old conversations
Great for building confidence.

### 7. Use a speaking tool
Better than vocabulary-only apps.

More methods are in the full guide with examples.
